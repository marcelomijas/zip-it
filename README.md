# zip-it!

Individually compress the folders in the working directory to "zip". Using the power of Python built-in modules.

## Instructions :blue_book: 

1. Download `zip-it.py` and place it in the directory where the folders you want to compress are located.
2. Execute `zip-it.py`.
3. The program will ask you if you want to proceed.

Optionally, an `zip-itExceptions.txt` file can be created in the same folder as the executable into which you can enter, line by line, the folders you want to exclude from compression.

## Use at your own risk! :warning:
- It only compresses folders :open_file_folder:, not individual files in the directory :page_facing_up:.
- Not recommended :no_entry: for very big/heavy folders :file_cabinet:.
- For the love of God, be careful :fire_extinguisher:.
